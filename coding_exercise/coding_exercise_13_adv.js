// You have a small remnant of mall data that is parsed into a shoppingMallData object. 
// They represent an array of data about markets, where the length
// and width of the premises are indicated; room height;
// the cost of heating per 1 cubic meter and the budget for paying for heating per month.
// The main task is to write an isBudgetEnough functionthat will return a string.
// If there is enough budget for heating the entire shopping center - 'Budget is enough'
// is displayed, if not - 'Budget is not enough'. And that's all ðŸ™‚
// But this problem contains several subtasks inside:
// - calculation of the total area of all stores, which is calculated as the length of the store, multiplied by the width;
// - calculation of the total volume of the shopping center, since the price of heating is indicated in cubic meters;
// - determination of whether the budget is enough for expenses of such a volume;
// - all numbers go without units for simplification, just numbers and that's it;
// - the function should continue to work even if the number of stores, height,
// budget is reduced, or another object is substituted.
